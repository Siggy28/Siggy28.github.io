<h2>Creation of Deathwish</h2>
<p>Deathwish Skateboards was founded in 2008 by two popular skaters, Jim Greco and Erik Ellington. Back in the days before Deathwish was founded,Jim and Erik realized that they had a lot of friends who would skate with them but were not
part of their team which at the time was Baker Skateboards.
The reason for that was that at the time, skate companies weren't making as much money as they wanted to. Unfortunately that meant that some talneted skaters would not be able to join the team due to the team
simply not having the funds to pay them. Jim and Erik decided to create Deathwish Skatebaords so that they could sign some of their friends to this new company and hope that with people seeing this up and coming skate team,
they would buy their products and that way, everyone on the team could start gettting paid. Luckily for Jim and Erik, they had friends who were willing to invest in the company and the creation of Deathwish skateboards was a success.</p>
