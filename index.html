<h2>Skate and Destroy!!!</h2>
<p>Baker Boys Distribution Company is one of the most popular skateboaridng distrtibution companies to exist.
It started with a group of skaters who had a dream of creating their own company one day, and it turned into them not only creating
Baker Skateboards, but also, Deathwish Skateboards, Heroin Skateboards, Shake Junt and Psockadelic.
These skate companies all fall under BakerBoys Distribution and a lot of the people behind these companies are the skaters themselves. </p>

<h3>Popularity</h3>
<p>While there are a lot of other competing skateboarding companies, Baker Boys Distribution and their teams have managed to stay in light since 2007.
The main reason for their popularity is due to the fact that a lot of the older guys on their team are credited with changing up the skateboarding world with
their crazy tricks, antics and ability to push themselves to new limits. They have inspired a lot of the younger skaters today and in a lot of interviews you will
hear a lot of familiar names from the Baker Boys Distribution team.</p>
